Pokedex built using React and Bootstrap for FlorinPop's Weekly Challenge. 

This project uses Firestore for serving some data which can be hard-coded into the JS but storing the data in local storage after one time download sounds better.
Also you can serve all the data at once using Firestore later minimising the use of API and hence increasing the speed of the pokedex as most of the data will be stored locally.
